# What's livestreamer windows shortcut?

It's a small batch file that only requires you to write in the streamers username and it will automaticly try to open the stream from first Hitbox.tv, and then Twitch.tv. 

If you just hit enter, it will grab whatever text you have in your clipboard directly and try to open it in livestreamer. Typing in a full URL try to open that directly, so it can open anything that livestreamer supports.

It's set to use best quality always, but that's easily editable with a text editor.
